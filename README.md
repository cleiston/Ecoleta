Project developed during the Next Level Week-1 by Rocketseat

## Setting up the server

Inside the server folder, open terminal and run the following:


"npm run knex:migrate" to create the database schema (sqlite)

"npm run knex:seed" to populate the tables with data used in the application.

## web page and mobile

Folder "web" contains a web page created with react.
Folder "mobile" contains the mobile aplication built with react native and expo.

The web page is used to create new points for collecting recycling items.
The mobile application displays the location of these points created. The user must inform the city and state.
